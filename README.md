# Learn Closures 
## Closure Demos and Practice Questions 


> In JavaScript, a first class function is a function that can be (1) assigned to variables, (2) passed as arguments and returned by other functions, or (3) included in another data structure.  Closures are created by defining an inner function inside a first class one.  Unlike a local variable, an inner function can be accessed from outside the first class function that created it using a closed over variable, or closure.  Thatâ€™s what makes closures significant.
