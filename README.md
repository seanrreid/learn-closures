# Learn Closures 
## Closure Demos and Practice Questions 

> With _scope_, we define variables as either **global** or **local**.  **Global variables** are those defined outside of functions, where as **local variables** are defined within them. Unlike **global variables**, **local variables** cannot be accessed outside the function that created it [...] think of a _first class** function_ as a **global variable**, and _inner functions_ as a **local variable**.
> In JavaScript, a first class function is a function that can be:
>
>   * (1) assigned to variables,
>   * (2) passed as arguments and returned by other functions, or 
>   * (3) included in another data structure.
>
> Closures are created by _defining an inner function inside a first class one_.  
>
> Unlike a local variable, **an inner function can be accessed from outside the first class function that created it using a closed over variable, or _closure_.**  
>
> A _closure_ is an object in JavaScript that is created when an _inner function is accessible from outside the function that created it_. Itâ€™s independent, and can be useful in simulating privacy as a design pattern.
